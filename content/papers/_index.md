{{<paper title="An Autoscaling Platform Supporting Graph Data Modelling Big Data Analytics" authors="Athanasios Kiourtis, Panagiotis Karamolegkos, Andreas Karabetian, Konstantinos Voulgaris, Yannis Poulakis, Argyro Mavrogiorgou, Dimosthenis Kyriazis" abstract="Big Data has proved to be vast and complex, without being efficiently manageable through traditional architectures, whereas data analysis is considered crucial for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Current analytics platforms are siloed for specific domains, whereas the requirements to enhance their use and lower their technicalities are continuously increasing. This paper describes a domain-agnostic single access autoscaling Big Data analytics platform, namely Diastema, as a collection of efficient and scalable components, offering userfriendly analytics through graph data modelling, supporting technical and nontechnical stakeholders. Diastemaâ€™s applicability is evaluated in healthcare through a predicting classifier for a COVID19 dataset, considering real-world constraints." date="2022/06/01" link="https://scholar.archive.org/work/ili5han7zrft5kr6fpbbkoqkau/access/wayback/https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/SHTI220743">}}
